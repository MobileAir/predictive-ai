You make 'If, then' statements. 'If you do this, you can't expect us to do that.' We haven't done that yet with a cyber doctrine to let people know, 'Hey If you attack us in this manner we are going to respond in kind.' I think that's an important step,” Tull said during a panel discussion.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity isn't the only risk on Solomon's radar. He's also focused on the changing market structure.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c8bc63d2400006c05a4ed4d.jpeg\" alt=\"David Solomon, co-president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Monday, May 1, 2017.

      "content": "<p><strong>For Immediate Release</strong></p>\n<p>Chicago, IL – March 15, 2019 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Civista Bancshares, Inc. CIVB, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Fifth Third Bancorp FITB and Chemung Financial Corp. CHMG.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog: </strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Don’t Write Off Banks, Play These 4 Low P/E Stocks in 2019</em></strong></p>\n<p>President Trump’s tax cuts have provided the required stimulus for growth to America’s banking industry over the past year. Further, banking regulations have been reasonably modified to boost the overall performance. This is why it wouldn’t be wrong to expect players from the space to be relatively less burdened in 2019 and therefore a tad more efficient.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Warren Buffett also vests his faith in America’s banks to surpass expectations this year. Taking such factors into consideration, investing in bank stocks seems prudent at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Warren Buffett Bullish on Banks in 2019</strong></p>\n<p>As of the latest 13F filings, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held roughly $76.1 billion worth of bank stocks at the end of 2018. Further, the filing also shed light on the fact that America’s most celebrated bank investor, Buffett, increased his bet on America’s biggest banks in the last quarter of 2018.</p>\n<p>While Berkshire added big banking players to his list, he trimmed his stake in only Wells Fargo. The worthy additions to the list included Bank of America, U.S. Bancorp, JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial. This clearly indicates that Buffett remains bullish on banks in 2019.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that while bank stocks keep finding favor in Berkshire’s portfolio, Buffett has trimmed down his bond holdings. Historically, while bank stocks benefit from rising interest rates and steepening yield curve, the bonds are impacted negatively from such economic events.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Buffett’s move toward big banks also shed light on the fact that he expects long-term interest rates to rise. This contrarian approach is largely expected to pay off in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Value Investors Should Consider Bank Stocks in 2019</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since the end of the last recession which started in 2009, it has been observed that investors targeting value stocks have focused more on banks. The reason for such a move is quite simple. Value investing fundamentally screens those stocks that have lower price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) than that of the broader market average.</p>\n<p>Moreover, diversified banks have an average forward P/E ratio of less than 10 compared with the market average of around 15. This is what makes bank stocks attractive to such investors. Moreover, it is largely expected that P/Es for large consumer banks will continue to lag the industry average this year as well.</p>\n<p>Further, bank stocks have also lagged the overall S&amp;P 500 over the past five years. As a matter of fact, the SPDR Bank Sector ETF (KBE) gained a meager 27.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 50.5% in the same period.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump’s Tax Deregulation a Major Boost to Banks</strong></p>\n<p>President Trump’s sweeping $1.5 trillion tax overhaul in 2017 has gone a long way in boosting the overall fortunes of America’s banking industry. The new tax code helped U.S. banks reduce their tax bills by a swashbuckling $21 billion in 2018 alone. Meanwhile, more than 70 banks in the United States have declared that they will hike wages or offers higher bonuses in the wake of the tax amendment.</p>\n<p><strong>4 Best Choices</strong></p>\n<p>Warren Buffett’s bullishness, opportunities for value investors and Trump’s deregulatory measures are expected to boost America’s banking industry in 2019.</p>\n<p>In this context, we have selected four bank stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). For each of these stocks the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is lesser than the industry average.

      "content": "<p>The semiconductor industry’s lackluster performance since late 2018 could turn around soon. The chip-making industry is primarily boosted by an uptick in data center segment, the reviving demand for chips and a possible U.S.-China trade deal.</p>\n<p><strong>Industry Stages Rebound in 2019</strong></p>\n<p>Semiconductor stocks powered the equity markets until last fall, largely driven by chip-making giants such as Nvidia NVDA. But the industry soon plummeted, dragged down by trade tensions and China’s economic slowdown.</p>\n<p>Although some segments of the industry are witnessing growth, many others encountered a decline in sales late last year. However, the industry is already witnessing a revival this year. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Index has gained 17.3% year to date.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Nvidia and Apple Lead the Rebound</strong></p>\n<p>This recovery is being largely propelled by positive news from Nvidia and Apple AAPL. Earlier this week, Nvidia announced its decision to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) for $6.8 billion in a bid to expand its data center business. Nvidia aims to enhance its reach in networking and connectivity on the back of its customized solutions and Mellalox’s know-how.</p>\n<p>Also, Apple’s stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by Bank of America BAC earlier this week, raising the 12-month price target to $210 from $180. The bank attributed its decision to the prospect of upbeat comparable store sales in 2019, a potential U.S.-China trade agreement and prospects of a huge buyback authorization in April.</p>\n<p>The bank also recently cited several risks that the sector faces. However, the iPhone maker’s price performance has witnessed an upward movement after suffering terribly in the fourth quarter. The company’s shares have outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 Index (16.4% vs 12.2%) on a year-to-date basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Semiconductor Industry Rebound Forecasts</strong></p>\n<p>Apart from the macroeconomic factors involved, the recent turbulence in the semiconductor industry is largely the result of its cyclical nature. It is notable that despite weak demand in late 2018, global chip sales increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis to $468.8 billion last year, Semiconductor Industry Association reported. The 2018 sales figure happens to be the chip industry’s highest annual total yet.</p>\n<p>In addition, RBC Capital Markets has forecast that the semiconductor industry will run out of steam around mid-2019 only to rise in the second half of the year. These reports could make the semiconductor space appealing to investors.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Invest in Semiconductor Stocks Now?</strong></p>\n<p>The emergence and fast evolution of new technologies such as 5G wireless networks, cloud computing, Internet-of-things and artificial intelligence have created a renewed demand for semiconductor chips. Chips are used to command everything from autonomous vehicles, data centers and video games in today’s world.</p>\n<p>Semiconductors are the main components that power hi-tech instruments, thus helping businesses perform efficiently and improving lives of consumers. It is this need for an enhanced technological experience that is pushing demand for chips and in turn driving semiconductor stock prices.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Choices</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, it would be advisable to invest in semiconductor stocks at this point. The following stocks have lucrative valuations and carry a Zacks Rank 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).</p>\n<p><strong>Synaptics Incorporated </strong>SYNA is a developer and manufacturer of intuitive human interface solutions for electronic products.

Citigroup C expects to achieve the cost control targets in 2019. This was stated by the company’s CFO Mark Mason at an investor conference. Also, he stressed on the importance of technology in the business. Nonetheless, Mason remained pessimistic about the market’s impact on Equities and Fixed Income business in the first quarter of 2019.

As part of its broader plan to expand into new markets, JPMorgan JPM expects to open 90 new branches by 2019. Additionally, the bank intends to hire roughly 700 employees to manage these branches.

Wells Fargo’s WFC CEO Timothy Sloan has received a total compensation of nearly $18.4 million for 2018, up nearly 5% year over year. Per the company’s proxy statement, the increase was mainly driven by $2 million given as bonus based on his full-year achievements. Despite the achievements, Wells Fargo had been in news throughout 2018, either for involvement in a scandal or for the Federal Reserve’s move to restrict asset growth.

In an aim to further capture lucrative exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market, JPMorgan announced that the JPMorgan BetaBuilders U.S. Equity ETF is expected to have a fee of 0.02%. With this, the bank launched America’s lowest-fee ETF yet to be offered, pushing the fee war to lower levels.

The $100.2 million in fines are the toughest actions yet taken by the regulator as part of its campaign against what it sees as shoddy listing standards.</p> \n<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday fined Swiss giant UBS HK$375 million (£36.27 million). It fined Morgan Stanley HK$224 million, Merrill Lynch HK$128 million and Standard Chartered (StanChart) HK$59.7 million, all for failures when sponsoring, or leading, IPOs. </p> \n<p>Helping firms to list is big business in Hong Kong, which was last year's top IPO destination worldwide with $36.3 billion raised, according to Refinitiv data. </p> \n<p>But, in the wake of a slew of scandals among newly traded firms earlier this decade, the SFC has been cracking down on banks not properly carrying out their duties as sponsor. </p> \n<p>Hong Kong IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank, which typically takes the lead in running the IPO and collects a larger proportion of fees than banks listed only as bookrunners. </p> \n<p>Sponsors must conduct due diligence to assess the company being listed, and are responsible for assuring potential investors that its IPO prospectus is accurate.</p> \n<p>The IPOs in question were those of China Forestry, sponsored by UBS and Standard Chartered, and Tianhe Chemicals, sponsored by UBS, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. </p> \n<p>UBS was also fined for failing to discharge its duties in a third IPO which the regulator did not name, but which sources have identified as China Metal Recycling (CMR), a now-defunct scrap merchant.</p> \n<p>\"The outcome of these enforcement actions for sponsor failures ... signify the crucial importance that the SFC places on the high standards of sponsors’ conduct to protect the investing public and maintain the integrity and reputation of Hong Kong’s financial markets,\" said Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, in a statement. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>SCEPTICISM FAILURES</p> \n<p>Fines in Hong Kong are based on up to three times the fees or profits made by the regulated group or person, less a discount for cooperation with the investigation. Morgan Stanley was fined more than Bank of America Merrill Lynch by the regulator because it took more of the fees from Tianhe for the IPO. </p> \n<p>China Forestry raised $216 million in its 2009 IPO. Just 14 months after listing, trading of its shares was suspended when its auditor discovered irregularities. The company was subsequently liquidated.</p> \n<p>Tianhe, engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical products, listed in 2014 but was soon after targeted by a short seller, who claimed it had inflated profits and presented related groups as customers. The company denied the allegations. </p> \n<p>Trading in its shares has been suspended since 2015. </p> \n<p>Among the failings described by the regulator was one instance where none of the three banks sponsoring Tianhe Chemical’s IPO followed up after interviewing the company’s largest customer as part of their sponsor due diligence. </p> \n<p>The meeting was arranged by Tianhe at its offices and the customer, named only as X, refused to give a business card or provide other identification to the banks’ representatives before storming out of the meeting. </p> \n<p>In the case of China Forestry, the SFC said UBS did not inspect any of the company’s forests after joining StanChart as a co-sponsor of the deal. While StanChart had visited some of the company’s forests, it failed to check the location of those sites against the locations given in the prospectus.</p> \n<p>\"We've seen this before in the accounting profession with the challenges to auditor scepticism. In some ways this is a similar situation for investment banks. The question now is has the industry moved on sufficiently from these failures,\" said one Hong Kong-based finance expert, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak on the subject. </p> \n<p>The SFC also on Thursday suspended the licence of UBS banker Cen Tian for failing to discharge his duties as sponsor principal in charge of the IPO of China Forestry, it said.</p> \n<p>Cen did not respond to an emailed request for comment. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>RESPONSES</p> \n<p>\"UBS takes note of the findings of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) investigations. We are pleased to have resolved these legacy issues relating to our Hong Kong IPO sponsorship licence. We look forward to continuing to service our clients in Hong Kong,\" UBS said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment. </p> \n<p>“We welcome the opportunity to resolve this case with the SFC, which stems from matters arising over 10 years ago. We note that on 8 January 2015, Standard Chartered Group announced the closure of institutional cash equities, equity research and equity capital markets activities (including IPO sponsor activities),\" StanChart said in a statement.</p> \n<p>StanChart closed its equity business in 2015. </p> \n<p>(The story is refiled to add dropped word 'million' regarding StanChart fine in paragraph three.)</p> \n<p></p> \n<p> (Reporting by Alun John, Additional reporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Jennifer Hughes, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Mark Potter)</p>\n<p></p>",

The company denied the allegations.</p> \n<p>Trading in its shares has been suspended since 2015.</p> \n<p>Among the failings described by the regulator was one instance where none of the three banks sponsoring Tianhe Chemical’s IPO followed up after interviewing the company’s largest customer as part of their sponsor due diligence.</p> \n<p>The meeting was arranged by Tianhe at its offices and the customer, named only as X, refused to give a business card or provide other identification to the banks’ representatives before storming out of the meeting.</p> \n<p>In the case of China Forestry, the SFC said UBS did not inspect any of the company’s forests after joining StanChart as a co-sponsor of the deal.

      "summary": "Thursday started off as a boring, choppy session and it ended that way too. In all honesty, it was probably the best thing bulls could have asked for. Extending much higher could cause stocks to become overbought in the short term. So they need to digest through price or through time and, with today's action anyway, it's choosing the latter. That doesn't mean there weren't big movers though. Let's look at some top stock trades.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: ClouderaDisappointing earnings results from Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) sent the stock spiraling, down almost 18% on the day. The move thrust CLDR below all of its major moving averages and through all notable levels of support.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy With High ESG Momentum Shares are now in no man's land in my eyes, and we'll need to see how the next few days shape up before touching this one. Should the selling persist or CLDR find itself in a downtrend, $10.50-ish could be the eventual target on the downside. Unfortunately, there are way too many cloud stocks that are doing well to want to be in this one. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: SnapAn upgrade to buy from BTIG sent shares of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) higher by 11% on Thursday. Save for a few long trades, I've never been a big fan of Snap stock. But over $10.50 and this name is looking much healthier.   Below $10.50 and bulls should limit their risk with this one, but over this mark and more upside seems possible. Particularly with a near-14% short interest in this name, a squeeze could propel Snap stock higher. As far as upside targets go, I'd watch for $12 and $12.80, respectively. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Bank of AmericaThe other day, I posted several bank stock charts to my Twitter account and with the sector acting well, I'd like to cover them in more depth here. This has been a choppy market, full of sector rotation. If banks gather some momentum, it could trigger a number of breakouts in the group. Starting with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), shares have been bouncing between $28 support and $29.50 resistance. Now above all of its major moving averages, not yet overbought and with an MACD swinging in bulls' favor, a rally could be in store. BAC needs to push over $29.50 with authority and if it can, a rally into the low-$30s is possible. Keep in mind though, this has been a tricky market with slow moves and tricky fake outs. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has a similar setup, chopping between $190 and $200 since mid-January.   If we can get a a close over $200, it could accelerate a rally up to the 200-day at $210. Below $190 is trouble. Keep it simple. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: JPMorganJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) doesn't have the same setup as BAC or GS, but nonetheless is deserving of some attention. Trending higher and over downtrend resistance (blue line), this name is struggling to breach $106. More so, the 200-day is just overhead at $106.93.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% If we can get a breakout over this area that sticks, a rally to $112 doesn't seem too aggressive. This has been a notable level over the past 12 months. On the downside, a close below uptrend support and/or the 50-day moving average would be a concern.
